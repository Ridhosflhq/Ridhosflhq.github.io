Hello, I'm Ridho Saifulhaq.

I have a passion for geospatial topics and graduated from the Cartography and Remote Sensing program at the Faculty of Geography, Universitas Gadjah Mada in Yogyakarta.

My interests lie in spatial research areas like urban studies, disaster management, vegetation, socio-cultural aspects, and environmental issues.

Thank you!
