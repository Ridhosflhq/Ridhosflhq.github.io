## Introduction

Understanding population distribution is crucial for urban planning, resource allocation, and policy-making. In this project, we will use R to visualize population data in Indonesia using an interactive 3D map powered by deck.gl. The data is sourced from the Kontur Population Dataset, which provides high-resolution global population estimates.

This project focuses on creating an **interactive 3D population map** using **deck.gl**, a high-performance WebGL-powered mapping library. The system retrieves **high-resolution population data** from the **Kontur Population Dataset**, applies color scaling based on density, and visualizes the results in an **interactive 3D environment** with **extruded polygons**.  

## Project Setup  

To build this **3D Population Visualization**, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:  

### Prerequisites
* **[R](https://cran.r-project.org/)** ‚Äì A statistical computing environment.  
* **[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)** ‚Äì A user-friendly IDE for R.  

### Required R Packages  
The following R packages are needed for this project:  

| Package        | Purpose |  
|---------------|---------|  
| `sf`          | Geospatial data processing |  
| `deckgl`      | WebGL-powered mapping visualization |  
| `R.utils`     | File handling and compression utilities |  
| `scales`      | Color scaling for data visualization |  
| `htmlwidgets` | Exporting interactive maps to HTML |    

## Building Map

Below are the key steps and script components:  

### Downloading the Population Dataset 
We will use **Kontur Population Data** and download it as a compressed `.gpkg.gz` file:  

```r
options(timeout = 300)
url <- "https://geodata-eu-central-1-kontur-public.s3.amazonaws.com/kontur_datasets/kontur_population_ID_20231101.gpkg.gz"
filename <- basename(url)

download.file(url, destfile = filename, mode = "wb")
R.utils::gunzip(filename, remove = FALSE)
```
### Loading and Transforming the Data
We use the sf package to read and convert the geospatial data to EPSG:4326 (WGS 84 projection):
```js
pop_df <- sf::st_read(
  dsn = gsub(".gz", "", filename)
) |> 
  sf::st_transform(crs = "EPSG:4326")
});
```
This allows the data to be correctly projected for visualization.

### Applying Color Scaling 
To visually differentiate population densities, we define a color palette using the `scales` package:
```js
pal <- scales::col_quantile("viridis", pop_df$population, n = 6)
pop_df$color <- pal(pop_df$population)
```
Each population polygon is assigned a color based on density.

### Creating the 3D Interactive Map
Now, we use *deck.gl* to render an interactive extruded polygon layer:
```js
properties <- list(
  stroked = TRUE,
  filled = TRUE,
  extruded = TRUE,
  wireframe = FALSE,
  elevationScale = 1,
  getFillColor = ~color,
  getLineColor = ~color,
  getElevation = ~population,
  getPolygon = deckgl::JS("d => d.geom.coordinates"),
  tooltip = "Population: {{population}}",
  opacity = 0.25
)
map <- deckgl::deckgl(
  latitude = -2.548926,
  longitude = 117.894722,
  zoom = 6, pitch = 45
) |> 
  deckgl::add_polygon_layer(data = pop_df, properties = properties) |> 
  deckgl::add_basemap(deckgl::use_carto_style())
```
This code:
* Extrudes polygons based on population values.
* Applies color-coded density representation.
* Enables interactive tooltips for population data.

### Exporting the Map as an HTML File
Finally, we save the interactive map as an HTML file:
```js
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(map, file = "map.html", selfcontained = FALSE)
```
After complete, you can open `map.html` in a browser to explore population density interactively!

## Summary
In this project, we successfully built an **interactive 3D population visualization** using **R and deck.gl**. The key steps included:  

* **Downloading** and extracting **Kontur Population Data**.  
* **Loading and transforming** geospatial data into **EPSG:4326 projection**.  
* **Applying color scaling** based on population density.  
* **Creating an interactive 3D map** with **extruded polygons** using **deck.gl**.  
* **Exporting the map** as an **HTML file** for easy sharing and visualization.  

With this workflow, we can analyze population distribution **visually and interactively**, making it useful for **urban planning, resource allocation, and demographic studies**.
