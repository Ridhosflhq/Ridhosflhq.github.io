This project uses HTML, JavaScript, and the Leaflet library to create an interactive web map. GeoJSON is used to store building data, which is dynamically loaded and visualized. Users can adjust the map center and see buildings color-coded based on distance, with base maps provided by OpenStreetMap, Google, and CartoDB.

### Interactive 3d Population Map

The interactive population map was created using deck.gl through R-Studio. The data used is the 2023 population contour data, which is publicly accessible.

### Interactive Web GIS for Route Navigation

The navigation map system was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Leaflet.js, enabling users to create and visualize optimal routes. The system includes interactive route mapping, allowing users to add multiple waypoints, draggable markers for adjusting locations dynamically, and a fixed-size direction legend with a scrollbar for improved readability. Additional refinements were made to enhance functionality, including features for adding, removing, and modifying waypoints.

### Biomass - Vegetation Indices using Python

The NDVI analysis was conducted using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python, processing Sentinel-2 imagery while addressing authentication and deprecation issues. The results were exported in formats such as GeoJSON or raster for further visualization and interpretation.

### Detail Spatial Plan Map ( RDTR-Rencana Detail Tata Ruang)

The RDTR (Detail Spatial Plan Map) is prepared through spatial analysis based on RDTR preparation guidelines and collaboration with various parties such as the government and community representatives.

### 1936 Topographic Map

The 1936 Topographic Map, originally a 1963 US AMS map for the Muntilan area, has been enhanced with a hillshade overlay derived from a section of DEMNAS data 1408_2. This modification was carried out using ArcGIS Pro software.

### 2024 Indonesia General Election Infographics

The infographic showcases a choropleth map illustrating the distribution of winning political parties across Indonesia's electoral districts. It includes the total vote counts (in millions) and the number of legislative representatives in parliament, represented by dots for each member. The information is derived from official data provided by KPU Indonesia and Kompas. This infographic was produced using QGIS and Inkscape software.

### Karst Flood Inundation Model

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24b72518-7ab5-4b59-8752-34a64b190394" alt="Karst Flood" style="width: 75%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

The compilation was done using modeling results derived from Lidar point cloud data. This data was then analyzed and used to model the rise and spread of floodwaters in a specific area. The animation provides a visual representation of the floodwater levels based on the processed Lidar data simulation results.

### The distribution map of new middle school students in Kutoarjo, Indonesia.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7d28eb-152a-4fe3-b82e-6f9ae72d4203" alt="middle school students" style="width: 75%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

The map was prepared to take part in the 2022 GISCI Map Competiton map competition. The map shows the distribution of houses for students accepted into the State Middle School PPDB program in Purworejo Regency in 2021 at 4 State Middle Schools in Kutoarjo. Data taken from the Purworejo Regency PPDB Website. Data is presented in several forms of presentation, making it easier to read the data.
